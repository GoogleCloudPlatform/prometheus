## 0.13.2 (2021-02-17)

## 0.13.1 (2020-12-04)

### Bug fixes

Fix versions of lezer packages depended on.

## 0.13.0 (2020-12-04)

### Breaking changes

`Parser.group` is now called `Parser.nodeSet`.

Nested parsers now work differently. They don't have to be Lezer parsers, but have to produce object conforoming to the `PartialParse` interface. The interface with which non-trivial nested parsers are specified also changedâ€”see the `NestedParser` type.

Parser objects no longer have a `topType` property (scan their node set for types with `isTop` set instead).

`Parser` objects no longer have `withProps`, `withNested`, and `withTokenizer` methods (use `configure` instead).

Both `Parser.parse` and `Parser.startParse` now take an optional start position as second parameter and an optional parse context as third. `startParse` returns an instance of the `PartialParse` interface instead of the old `ParseContext` class (whose name is now used for something else). Parse _options_ are no longer passed to these methods, but configured in advance through `Parser.configure`.

During incremental parsing, instead of passing a tree as the `cache` option, reusable subtrees (see `TreeFragment` from lezer-tree) are now retrieved from the `fragments` property of the parse context object, if provided.

`Parser.parse` and `Parser.startParse` no longer take an options parameter. Instead, `bufferLength` and `strict` can be configured with `Parser.configure` now, and the start position and context are passed as optional arguments.

The `InputStream` type has been replaced by `Input` from the lezer-tree package (which has the same interface but a more appropriate name).

### New features

The `Parser` class now has a `configure` method that is used to create a parser instance with a more specific configuration.

## 0.12.1 (2020-11-19)

### Bug fixes

Fix an infinite loop in incremental parsing when repeatedly reusing a zero-length cached node.

## 0.12.0 (2020-10-23)

### Breaking changes

Follow the change from `Subtree` to `TreeCursor` in lezer-tree.

The serialized parser format changed.

`Stack.startOf` now returns null, rather than -1, when it can't find the given element.

### New features

`Stack.startOf` now takes an optional second argument that allows you to select a match beyond the innermost one.

## 0.11.2 (2020-09-26)

### Bug fixes

Fix lezer depencency versions

## 0.11.1 (2020-09-26)

### Bug fixes

Fix an infinite loop that was sometimes hit during error recovery.

## 0.11.0 (2020-09-26)

### Breaking changes

Follow a breaking change in the way repeat nodes are represented.

Support the new action table format that allows sharing between states.

## 0.10.4 (2020-09-15)

### New features

Parser objects now have a `withTokenizer` method that can be used to replace external tokenizers.

## 0.10.3 (2020-09-10)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug that caused the value returned by `ParseContext.badness` to be much higher than intended.

## 0.10.2 (2020-09-02)

### Bug fixes

`Stack.ruleStart` will now ignore repeat rules and node-less rules when determining the inner rule.

Work around a failure mode where error-recovery got stuck in an end-of-grammar state and thus could not continue meaningfully parsing anything by restarting such states back to their initial state.

### New features

External tokenizers can now provide an `extend` flag to allow their tokens to be used alongside tokens produced by other tokenizers.

Add support for dynamic precedences.

## 0.10.1 (2020-08-20)

### Bug fixes

Fixes an issue where repeated error recovery could lead to a tree so deep that recursive functions on it would overflow the stack.

## 0.10.0 (2020-08-07)

### New features

Add support for grammar dialects.

Add support for external specializers.

Stacks now have a `parser` accessor that gets you the active parser instance.

### Breaking changes

No longer list internal properties in the type definitions.

Follow changes in the serialized parser format.

The way different tokenizers are combined is now slightly different. The first one to return a token wins, even if that token has no actions in the current state. The old behavior, where further tokenizers are tried until actions are found, can be enabled for a given tokenizer by setting its `fallback` flag.

Tweak recovery cost for forced reductions to prefer those to other recovery strategies.

More agressively reuse cached nodes.

## 0.7.0 (2020-01-20)

### Breaking changes

This now consumes the adjusted parser output of lezer-generator 0.7.0.

## 0.6.0 (2020-01-15)

### Bug fixes

Rewrite the way the parser advances and recovers from errors, to more rigorously address a number of infinite loops and poor recovery behaviors.

### New features

Parse context objects now have a `badness` property that you can use to estimate just how poorly the input matches the grammar.

## 0.5.2 (2020-01-09)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where the parser will sometimes continue, and even pick as result, a parse with error recovery even though there are error-free parses available.

Fix a mistake in our binary heap implementation that would cause stacks to be ordered incorrectly.

Fix an issue where the `Stack.startOf` method would ignore the top frame of the stack.

## 0.4.0 (2019-09-10)

Don't rely on additional data stored in the parse table during recovery (shrinking the parse tables).

Fix a crash that could occur when starting a nested parse when there were multiple active stacks.

Fix an issue where error nodes would sometimes not be merged.

Don't reuse cached tokens for states that have a different token group.

### Breaking changes

The on-disk parse table format changed again.

## 0.3.0 (2019-08-22)
